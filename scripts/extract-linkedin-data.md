# LinkedIn Profile Data Extraction Guide

Since LinkedIn blocks automated access, please follow these steps to extract your profile data:

## Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste (Recommended)

1. Open your LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/erkumardevender/
2. Copy the following sections and paste them here:
   - **Name and Headline** (at the top)
   - **About/Summary** section
   - **Experience** (all positions)
   - **Education**
   - **Skills** (top skills)
   - **Location**

## Option 2: Export LinkedIn Data

1. Go to LinkedIn Settings & Privacy
2. Click "Data Privacy" → "Get a copy of your data"
3. Select "Profile" and request archive
4. Once received, extract the relevant information

## Option 3: Use Browser Developer Tools

1. Open your LinkedIn profile in a browser
2. Right-click → Inspect
3. Look for structured data in the page source
4. Copy relevant JSON-LD or meta tags

Once you provide the information, I'll update the `data/portfolio.ts` file automatically!
